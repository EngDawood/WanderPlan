# AI Travel Planner - Overview

## The Idea
The AI Travel Planner is a full-stack web application designed to take the stress out of trip planning. By leveraging the power of **Google's Gemini AI** and the **Google Maps Places API**, the application allows users to input a destination city and instantly receive a curated, day-long itinerary broken down into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening sections.

Instead of spending hours researching places to go, users get a smart, AI-generated baseline that they can then customize, save, and manage.

## Core Objectives
1. **Instant Inspiration**: Use AI to generate realistic, geographically logical itineraries.
2. **Rich Context**: Provide rich details for every location (photos, ratings, opening hours, directions) via Google Maps.
3. **Customization**: Allow users to add custom notes to places and favorite locations they love.
4. **Persistence**: Save generated itineraries to a database so they can be accessed later.

## Target Audience
Travelers, digital nomads, and vacationers who want a quick, structured starting point for their trips without having to manually research and piece together locations.
